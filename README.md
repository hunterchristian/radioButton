Dynamically constructs custom-image themed radio buttons within an HTML document.

## Installation

radioButton is registered as a Bower package. If you don't have Bower, you can install it by executing the following statement from the command line:
'''sh
$ npm install -g bower

Bower depends on [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and [npm](http://npmjs.org/). Also make sure that [git](http://git-scm.com/) is installed as some bower
packages require it to be fetched and installed.
